# My Portfolio Website

## Description

Project created as part of my Full Stack developer course. Project consists on a simple static website where 
you can find a bit of information about myself on the About Me section. Also will contain the projects I have developed so far and a description of every project.
The site will also contain a contact information section.

## Development

The site is divided onto 3 pages: Home, Projects and Contact. Following the same style for each of them we find a menu and same proportions on body properties and colors for each section. From the menu you can access to the pages as well as the sections in Home page.

### Home Page

This page is divided mainly in 2 areas, 1st area a About section that contains a bit of information about myself. 
Second area it cointed a styled list where i will be adding all the projects i will be creating during this course. Each project will be linked to its own page where said project will be explained on detail.

### Project page

Here its all about disecting the project onto the description and goal of the project and how every section of it works.

### Contact page

Simple page that contains a styled section where to add contact details.

## JavaScript use

At the moment JavaScript its only used on the menu's project section to show the project's list when you hover over the project's tab, so you can click on each project and will take you to the project's webpage, alternatively you can click on 'projects' tab and will take you to the project section in the Home page.

## Media Queries

Although I have added different styles for diferent screen sizes, some more work can be put into it that i hope to perfect while completing this course. There is 3 distinctives style depending on the size of the view port.
