                <h2>Welcome to my Workshop!!!</h2>
                <p>Hello, my name is Manuel Delgado from and I am Spansh. I started my coding career long time ago but for personal reasons had to leave it. Left my country 
                ten years ago to find my place in the world only to realised i have already found it and forgot about it for a while</p><br>
                <p>I found a company where they train you to find a job of what i love and soon after I was introduced to this fantastic website that is Codecady. 
                where after completing my Full Stack Developer path I want to use to learn and make me a great Web Developer. Right now there is not much to see on site
                but at the end of this curse i will be filled with all the interesting projects i will be developing.a</p><br>
                <p>On my free time i love to do some gaming to take the steam off, my preferences are shooter, adventures and horror games!! I also do enjoy watching a good movie, usually
                enjoying the company of my cat Gwen.
